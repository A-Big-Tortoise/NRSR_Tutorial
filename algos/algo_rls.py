def algo_rls(signal, d_signal, mu=0.1, w="random", show=False):
    """
    Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive filtering algorithm for signal processing.

    Parameters:
        signal (array): The input signal to be filtered.
        d_signal (array): The desired signal (reference signal) for comparison.
        mu (float, optional): Forgetting factor or regularization parameter, default is 0.1.
        w (array or str, optional): Initial filter parameters (weights).
            If "random," random initial weights are used. Otherwise, provide a custom array.
        show (bool, optional): If True, display a plot of the filtered signal and error.

    Returns:
        y (array): The filtered output signal.
        error (array): The error signal (the difference between the desired signal and the filtered output).
        weights (array): The set of filter parameters at the end of the simulation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the dimension of the input signal is not 1 or 2.

    This function implements the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm, which is an adaptive
    filtering technique used to estimate filter weights that minimize the mean square error
    between the filtered output (y) and the desired signal (d_signal).

    The RLS algorithm adapts the filter weights using a recursive approach, making it suitable
    for various applications in signal processing and adaptive filtering.
